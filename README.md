# Nxxt
A repository for releases of Nxxt Autoclicker.
This is where all of the executables will be posted as releases.
No source code will be uploaded here.

## Using Nxxt
Nxxt is a completely stand-alone executable. It shouldn't have any dependencies.


### Windows Defender
Running Nxxt between versions B1 and B2 might greet you with a "Windows protected your PC" screen.

This is Windows Defender's SmartScreen. It recognises .exe files with no publisher
and gives you a fair warning. To run the executable anyways (in case you see this),
click on the "More Info" text and then click the "Run Anyway" button.
